# Locate the SDL2_image library. This CMake module is a modified version
# of the original FindSDL_image.cmake file
# ###########################################################################
# Locate SDL_image library
# This module defines
# SDL2IMAGE_LIBRARY, the name of the library to link against
# SDLIMAGE_FOUND, if false, do not try to link to SDL
# SDL2IMAGE_INCLUDE_DIR, where to find SDL/SDL.h
#
# $SDLDIR is an environment variable that would
# correspond to the ./configure --prefix=$SDLDIR
# used in building SDL.
#
# Created by Eric Wing. This was influenced by the FindSDL.cmake 
# module, but with modifications to recognize OS X frameworks and 
# additional Unix paths (FreeBSD, etc).
