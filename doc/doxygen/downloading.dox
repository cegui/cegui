/**
@page downloading Obtaining the code
@author Paul D Turner

CEGUI is presently available in source code form only. You can either download a
release archive package or clone the code from the mercurial repository at
bitbucket.org (both unstable default branch and stable branch code available).
@note There are no current plans to provide precompiled binary versions of the
library. Things go much more smoothly when you compile everything yourself on
the same system - this cuts down @e hugely on configuration mismatches and
generally prevents many of the common user errors we have encountered multiple
times over the years.

All released packages are made available through the sourceforge.net file
release network of mirrors, and you can browse the available releases by
visiting: http://sourceforge.net/projects/crayzedsgui/files/

For an alternative view of these packages, you might like to visit the CEGUIWiki
main download page here: http://www.cegui.org.uk/wiki/index.php/Downloads

@section dl_src_releases Stable Release Source Packages
Source code from the stable mercurial branch is released at various points in
time and made available as source code packages.

The current and previous releases are available here: <a href="http://cegui.org.uk/download">http://cegui.org.uk/download</a>

The content of these archives (.zip, .tar.gz) is identical, multiple archive types are provided
merely as a convenience.

@section dl_deps Dependency Package for Microsoft Windows and Apple OS X
In order to make life simpler for Windows and OS X developers, we provide a
package containing the source code for the dependency libraries that CEGUI uses.
For more information about this, including build information, please refer to
@ref building_deps

The current package is available <a href="https://bitbucket.org/cegui/cegui-dependencies/get/v0-8.zip">here</a>

@section dl_hg Mercurial Source Code Repository
The source code for CEGUI is kept in a mercurial repositiory at bitbucket.org.
We also have the code repositories for other CEGUI related items hosted at
bitbucket; the repository for the main CEGUI libraries is named 'cegui'.

Within this repository, we maintain the main unstable code (as the default
branch) and secondary branches for the current API stable and ABI stable
releases (which are v0 and v0-8 respectively as of this writing), older branches
are considered obsolete as newer stable code branches are created, although the
older branches are still accessible for those who want or need that older code.

To obtain a copy of the code from mercurial, you might use the following commands
(or thier equivalent, if you use a GUI based mercurial client)
@verbatim
hg clone https://bitbucket.org/cegui/cegui cegui-source
@endverbatim

Once you have this, the cloned repository is updated to the default (unstable)
code, so you most likely will want to switch to the API stable branch instead
(be aware that the -C option here will discard any local file changes without
additional warning):
@verbatim
hg update -C v0
@endverbatim

You can also browse the repository from your web browser here:
