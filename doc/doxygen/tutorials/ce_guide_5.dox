Having read the previous tutorials in this series, you now have your GUI
rendering set up, the files loaded and even have a window on screen - however
you are probably wanting to have some user interaction too.  This is the subject
of this final tutorial in the series; here we will show the required tasks in
order to end up with a complete functioning GUI in your application.

<br>
@section input_tutorial_intro Introduction to input for CEGUI

@subsection input_tutorial_intro_badnews First the bad news
It shocks some people to discover that CEGUI does not do any automatic
collection of user input; it is the responsibility of the application itself to
tell CEGUI about any events that it needs to know about.  This means that you
have to tell CEGUI each time a key is pressed, or the mouse moves, and so on.
While this may seem strange at first, the reality is that it affords you a lot
more power and flexibility; we are not tying you down to any particular system
for your inputs, and you may additionally filter input before it gets to CEGUI,
although these are more advanced concepts best left for another time.

@subsection input_tutorial_intro_injectors Get your inputs injected
In order to tell CEGUI about the input events going on around it, we have an
input injection interface (CEGUI::InjectedInputReceiver). This provides one
member function for each type of base input:

- bool InjectedInputReceiver::injectMouseMove( float delta_x, float delta_y );
- bool InjectedInputReceiver::injectMousePosition( float x_pos, float y_pos );
- bool InjectedInputReceiver::injectMouseLeaves( void );
- bool InjectedInputReceiver::injectMouseButtonDown( MouseButton button );
- bool InjectedInputReceiver::injectMouseButtonUp( MouseButton button );
- bool InjectedInputReceiver::injectKeyDown( Key::Scan scan_code );
- bool InjectedInputReceiver::injectKeyUp( Key::Scan scan_code );
- bool InjectedInputReceiver::injectChar( utf32 code_point );
- bool InjectedInputReceiver::injectMouseWheelChange( float delta );

And also some optional functions for click and multi-click events (which are
normally automatically generated internally by the system):
- bool InjectedInputReceiver::injectMouseButtonClick( MouseButton button );
- bool InjectedInputReceiver::injectMouseButtonDoubleClick( MouseButton button );
- bool InjectedInputReceiver::injectMouseButtonTripleClick( MouseButton button );

Yes, that's quite a collection!  The first thing that you might notice is that
there appears to be some repetition - things like 'mouse move' and
'mouse position', 'key down' and 'char'.  For the mouse, we offer the
possibility of injecting a relative movement of the mouse from it's last
injected location or an absolute position - which one of these you choose will
largely depend upon the type of inputs that your input library provides you with
for the mouse.  For keys, it is generally required that both up/down strokes and
also characters are injected - there are a couple of reasons for this; first,
not all keys generate a character code (like shift, alt, and so on), and second,
it allows you to do your own custom (or operating system supplied) key-mapping
and key auto-repeat (since CEGUI does not currently offer these functions).

The other thing to notice is the boolean return value from the injection
functions.  This is used to relay back to your application whether or not CEGUI
actually consumed the input.  If this returns false, it means that CEGUI did
nothing useful with the input, and that your application may like to perform
some action based on it instead.  Generally for this to work as described, you
should have a fullscreen DefaultWindow as your layout root with the
CursorPassThroughEnabled property set to true.

Finally, you must know that InjectedInputReceiver is implemented by InputAggregator.
In the next section you can read about the new input events system.

<br>
@section input_tutorial_inputevents Input Events System
Starting with version YYY of CEGUI, the input system has changed completely.
While previously it worked with raw injected inputs in the GUIContext, now it
uses the concept of <strong>input event</strong>. This is a generic term for
an event which represents the end result of a (sequence) of input(s). For example,
the mouse buttons pressed and released can represent an activation event, the
combination of keys CTRL and V represent a paste event; and so on. With this
new way of getting input we can easily implement support for new devices
without having to emulate a keyboard/mouse. We can also implement GUI
navigation - you can check the @ref gui_navigation_tutorial for details.

The input events are a central part of the new input system. In the
default implementation the InputAggregator takes in raw input and
generates input events based on it. There are currently two
default input events:
- TextInputEvent - An event with a character payload.
- SemanticInputEvent - An event with a semantic value and a payload. This event
tries to cover some specific input events with a certain semantic.

There are a bunch of values defined by default in the SemanticValue
enumeration. You can create your own semantic values, and in order to
prevent collisions with the default ones, there is a value called
SemanticValue::SV_UserDefinedSemanticValue, which signals the minimum
value of a user-defined semantic value. The payload of a semantic input event
is a union which covers most of the usage cases: either a single or a double
float, or in the case of a cursor (see below), the source of the cursor (left,
right, middle). There is also no more knowledge of a mouse. Instead the generic
term Cursor is used, because this can represent also a touch pointer.

You can create a totally different InputAggregator or you can
inherit the default behaviour while adding new semantics. Such example
can be consulted in the Scrollable_Pane sample. One scenario where
you would create a new InputAggregator is when you want to support additional
semantics or add a new type of input device: touch, Kinect, gamepad, etc.
For example, in the case of Kinect you could generate a TextEvent with the
spoken words or create an on-screen keyboard (sample coming soon) which
will generate TextEvents based on activation events.

You can manually inject input events into the GUIContext or you can use
the decorator-like pattern, by creating a new InputAggregator attached
to the GUIContext. Then, you can inject the raw input like you did before
in the InputAggregator, which in turn will generate and inject the input
events into the GUIContext.

@section input_tutorial_detail A little more detail: What each injector is used for
Here we will offer a brief description of what each injection function is used
for, the data it expects, and what, in general, is done with the input.

@subsection input_tutorial_mousemove bool InjectedInputReceiver::injectMouseMove( float delta_x, float delta_y )
This is used to inject relative mouse movements.  The vales @c delta_x and
@c delta_y specify the direction and number of screen pixels the mouse has moved
on the x axis and y axis respectively.  This causes the mouse to move by the
specified amount (the actual amount moved can be changed by setting a mouse
scaling factor via the InjectedInputReceiver::setMouseMoveScaling function).
If you use this, you generally do not need to use injectMousePosition.

@subsection input_tutorial_mousepos bool InjectedInputReceiver::injectMousePosition( float x_pos, float y_pos )
This is used to inject the current absolute position of the mouse.  The values
@c x_pos and @c y_pos specify the position of the mouse in pixels, where a
position of (0, 0) represents the top-left hand corner of the CEGUI display
(so if you're in windowed mode, it's the corner of the window and not the corner
of the entire screen).  The CEGUI mouse cursor will be set to the new position.
If you use this, you generally do not need to use injectMouseMove.

@subsection input_tutorial_mouseleaves bool InjectedInputReceiver::injectMouseLeaves( void )
This function informs CEGUI that the mouse cursor has left the host window that
CEGUI considers it's rendering area.  This is useful if running in windowed mode
to inform widgets that the mouse has actually left the CEGUI display completely
(otherwise it may not get to know, since under many systems no more mouse events
are generated for an OS window once the mouse has left it).

@subsection input_tutorial_mbdown bool InjectedInputReceiver::injectMouseButtonDown( MouseButton button )
This tells CEGUI that a mouse button has been pressed down.  The value @c button
is one of the CEGUI::MouseButton enumerated values, which are as follows:
@code
enum MouseButton
{
    LeftButton,
    RightButton,
    MiddleButton,
    X1Button,
    X2Button,
    MouseButtonCount,
    NoButton
};
@endcode

If the values from your input library do not match these, you will have to
perform a translation step.  Also note that the value NoButton is not 0.

@subsection input_tutorial_mbup bool InjectedInputReceiver::injectMouseButtonUp( MouseButton button )
This tells CEGUI that a mouse button has been released.  As for the
InjectedInputReceiver::injectMouseButtonDown function, the value @c button is
one of the CEGUI::MouseButton enumerated values.

@subsection input_tutorial_keydown bool InjectedInputReceiver::injectKeyDown( Key::Scan scan_code )
This tells CEGUI that a key has been pressed.  The value @c scan_code is the scan
code for the key - note that this is not an ASCII or other text encoding value.
The available scan codes are defined in the CEGUI::Key::Scan enumeration.  If
you are using Microsoft DirectInput, then our scan codes are the same ones
output by that library, in other cases you may be required to perform some
translation.  Note that for current releases, and depending upon your expected
use, it may not be required to inject @e all key down/up strokes - the most
common ones that you likely will need are for backspace, delete, enter, the
shift keys and the arrow keys.

At present no automatic key mapping and generation of character codes is
performed, also there is no integrated key auto-repeat functionality - though
these functions may appear in future releases.  If you need key auto-repeat then
you will need to either use an input library that offers this function, or
implement something directly.  Of course you will almost certainly need
character input, so for that look at the InjectedInputReceiver::injectChar
function below.

@subsection input_tutorial_keyup bool InjectedInputReceiver::injectKeyUp( Key::Scan scan_code )
This tells CEGUI that a key has been released.  As for the
InjectedInputReceiver::injectKeyDown function, the value @c scan_code is a scan
code for the key - and again note that this is not an ASCII or other text
encoding value - see above for a more detailed description of the key scan
codes.

@subsection input_tutorial_char bool InjectedInputReceiver::injectChar( utf32 code_point )
This function tells CEGUI that a character key has been pressed - you will need
this in order to input text into CEGUI widgets.  The value @c code_point' is a
Unicode UTF32 code point value (see the unicode website at http://unicode.org/
for information about unicode).  How you obtain this value is something that is
dependant upon the input library that you are using.  For many people, who just
wish to use ASCII values, you can just pass in your ASCII codes unmodified,
since Unicode values between 0 and 127 are the same as the standard ASCII codes.
For other uses, you will need to consult the API documentation for your input
library (it is possible, for example, to get the Microsoft Windows message pump
to send you key codes in UTF32 form, though exactly how it is done is beyond the
scope of this introductory tutorial).

@subsection input_tutorial_mwheel bool InjectedInputReceiver::injectMouseWheelChange( float delta )
This function is used to tell CEGUI about the use of the mouse wheel or scroll
wheel (whatever you like to call it!).  Use positive values for forward movement
(rolling the wheel away from the user), and negative values for backwards
movement (rolling the wheel towards the user).

@subsection input_tutorial_click bool InjectedInputReceiver::injectMouseButtonClick( MouseButton button )
This is an optional injection function that informs CEGUI that a mouse button
click has occurred; normally that is a down -> up sequence.  Calling this
function is only necessary if the built-in automatic generation of click and
multi-click events is unsuitable for your needs.  If you decide you need to use
this function you will normally disable the automatic event generation first by
way of the InputAggregator::setMouseClickEventGenerationEnabled function.  While it is
possible to call this injection function \e without disabling the auto generated
events, it will affect the behaviour as to the way events are marked as
'handled' and therefore the return code from this function.

@subsection input_tutorial_doubleclick bool InjectedInputReceiver::injectMouseButtonDoubleClick( MouseButton button )
This is an optional injection function that informs CEGUI that a mouse button
double-click has occurred; normally that is a down -> up -> down sequence.
Calling this function is only necessary if the built-in automatic generation of
click and multi-click events is unsuitable for your needs.  If you decide you
need to use this function you will normally disable the automatic event
generation first by way of the InputAggregator::setMouseClickEventGenerationEnabled
function.  While it is possible to call this injection function \e without
disabling the auto generated events, it will affect the behaviour as to the way
events are marked as 'handled' and therefore the return code from this function.

@subsection input_tutorial_tripleclick bool InjectedInputReceiver::injectMouseButtonTripleClick( MouseButton button )
This is an optional injection function that informs CEGUI that a mouse button
triple-click has occurred; normally that is a down -> up -> down -> up -> down
sequence.  Calling this function is only necessary if the built-in automatic
generation of click and multi-click events is unsuitable for your needs.  If you
decide you need to use this function you will normally disable the automatic
event generation first by way of the
InputAggregator::setMouseClickEventGenerationEnabled function.  While it is possible
to call this injection function \e without disabling the auto generated events,
it will affect the behaviour as to the way events are marked as 'handled' and
therefore the return code from this function.

@section input_tutorial_migration Migrating from raw injected input to input events
The migration from the usage of GUIContext to inject input to the new input events
is an easy one, especially if you want to use the default previous behaviour.

First thing to note is that the InjectedInputReceiver interface doesn't contain
the injectTimePulse method anymore. Time pulses are now injected directly in the 
GUIContext. GUIContext doesn't implement InjectedInputReceiver anymore. Instead,
a new class called InputAggregator will do that job. Thus, all calls that previously
injected input in GUIContext will now inject in an InputAggregator instance.
For details on what the InputAggregator does please check above. To migrate
you need to perform the following steps - code examples are taken from the samples
(framework):

- Create an InputAggregator instance, and pass a GUIContext to its constructor
@code
d_inputAggregator = new InputAggregator(&CEGUI::System::getSingletonPtr()->getDefaultGUIContext());
@endcode
- Convert code like:
@code
CEGUI::System::getSingletonPtr()->injectMousePosition(x, y);
@endcode
to:
@code
d_inputAggregator->injectMousePosition(x, y);
@endcode

@section input_tutorial_conclusion Conclusion
Here we have seen the general idiom that CEGUI uses for obtaining externally
generated input events.  We have seen the methods for passing these inputs to
CEGUI, and the type and format of the information to be passed.

Unlike some of the other tutorials in this series, we did not provide concrete
code examples.  The main reason for this was to keep the tutorial reasonably
short; to prevent it becoming a jumble of code for every possible combination of
input system, and in the process causing more confusion.  The use of any
individual input library could easily fill a tutorial of it's own.
