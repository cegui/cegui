This is Crazy Eddie's GUI System Mk-2; a free library providing windowing and
widgets for graphics APIs and engines where such functionality is not natively
available or is severely lacking. The library is written in C++, is object
orientated, and is primarily targeted at games developers who should be spending
their time creating great games, not building GUI sub-systems...

Note: In various documentation and online, the system is additionally referred
to as both CEGUI (which is the main namespace name), and cegui_mk2 (which was the
CVS module name of the Mk2 version of the system, and is now the mercurial
repository name for this part of the system).
