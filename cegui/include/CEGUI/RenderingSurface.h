\brief
    Class that represents a surface that can have geometry based imagery drawn
    to it.

    A RenderingSurface has a number of queues that can be used for rendering;
    normal window rendering will typically be done on RQ_BASE queue, things that
    are overlaid everything else are rendered to RQ_OVERLAY.
    \par
    The event EventRenderQueueStarted is fired before each queue is rendered and
    the event EventRenderQueueEnded is fired after each queue is rendered.
    \note
    For performance reasons, events are only fired for queues that are in use;
    these are queues that have had some interaction - such as clearing or adding
    geometry.
