\brief A positioned and sized rectangular node in a tree graph

This class implements positioning, alignment, sizing including minimum and
maximum size constraining. In its bare essense it's an unnamed rectangular node
that may contain other unnamed rectangular nodes.

Unless you are implementing new CEGUI functionality you do NOT want to use this
class directly. You most likely want to use CEGUI::Window.

\see CEGUI::Window

\internal
    Currently only CEGUI::Window uses this but in the future Falagard might use
    it for all widget parts, this would unify much of currently repeated code.

\internal
    Methods retrieving Element (like getParentElement) have Element suffix so
    that deriving classes can easily make their getParent and return the proper
    casted type (Window* for example).

    \par Impact on the element tree
        Lets say we have Element A with child Element B, A is pixel aligned
        and it's position is 99.5, 99.5 px in screenspace. This gives us
        100, 100 px pixel aligned position.

        B's position is always relative to the pixel-aligned position of its
        parent. Say B isn't pixel-aligned and it's position is 0.5, 0.5 px.
        Its final position will be 100.5, 100.5 px in screenspace, not 100, 100 px!

        If it were pixel-aligned the final position would be 101, 101 px.

    \par Why you should pixel-align widgets
        Pixel aligning is enabled by default and for most widgets it makes
        a lot of sense and just looks better. Especially with text. However for
        HUD or decorative elements pixel aligning might make transitions less
        fluid. Feel free to experiment with the setting.

    \brief
        Get a lower bound for the element height as an affine function of the
        height of the area of the element which is reserved for content.

        An affine function means: "m" is an affine function of "t" if, for some
        constants "a" and "b", it holds true that "m = a*t +b".

        The meaning of "content" depends on the type of element. For instance,
        the content of a "FalagardStaticText" widget is its text. The area
        reserved for the content would then be the area reserved for the text,
        which is defined by the Look'N'Feel, and usually equals the size of the
        widget minus the size of the frame and scrollbars.

        This method is used by "adjustSizeToContent".

        The default implementaiton inverts the function returned by
        "getWidthOfAreaReservedForContentLowerBoundAsFuncOfElementWidth". If the
        scale of the value returned by
        "getWidthOfAreaReservedForContentLowerBoundAsFuncOfElementWidth" is 0,
        there's no solution, so an exception is thrown.

        An implementation of "adjustSizeToContent" that works for simple cases.

        Set the size of the element using the following logic:
        1) If the "AdjustWidthToContent" property is set to "true", do:
            A. Compute the content width by calling "getContentWidth".
            B. Compute a lower bound for the element width as a function of
               width of the area reserved for the element content by calling
               "getElementWidthLowerBoundAsFuncOfWidthOfAreaReservedForContent"
            C. Use the results from "A" and "B" to compute a suitable element
               width - that is, such as that the width of the area reserved for
               the content be at least the result from "A".
        2) Repeat the same steps of "1", replacing "width" with "height".

        Note that in this implementation the width and height are treated
        independently of each other.

        If "getAspectMode() != AM_IGNORE", this method respects the aspect ratio
        using the following logic:
            - If only "isWidthAdjustedToContent()" is true, compute the height
              from the width and the aspect ratio.
            - If only "isHeightAdjustedToContent()" is true, compute the width
              from the height and the aspect ratio.
            - If both "isWidthAdjustedToContent()" and
              "isHeightAdjustedToContent()" are true, expand one of the width or
              the height to comply with the aspect ratio.

        it's possible that if we use the exact value obtained, we might not
        achieve this goal fully. Therefore, we should, at some points of the
        computation, add a tiny number ("epsilon") serving as a "safety guard".
        This method returns the epsilon to use.

    \brief
        A helper method that can be used in the implementation of
        "adjustSizeToContent" for non-simple cases.

        This method tries to find a suitable size by try-and-error: It's given a
        (mathematical) function "f(n)" whose domain is the integers between
        "floor(domain_min)" and "ceil(domain_max)", and its codomain is R^2
        (representing possible element sizes - i.e. of type "Sizef"). This
        method finds the minimal "n" for which
        "contentFitsForSpecifiedElementSize(f(n))" returns "true" - that is, for
        which the whole element content is visible without the need for
        scrollbars (if possible), and while the content remains "intact" (if
        possible). The (mathematical) function "f(n)" is an affine function
        defined by:
            f(n) = (size_func.d_width.d_scale*n +size_func.d_width.d_offset,
                    size_func.d_height.d_scale*n +size_func.d_height.d_offset)

        Note: it's assumed that
        "contentFitsForSpecifiedElementSize(f(domain_min))" returns "false" and
        "contentFitsForSpecifiedElementSize(f(domain_max))" returns "true".

        This method uses bisection to find the solution.

        You might want to look at "FalagardStaticText::adjustSizeToContent" to
        see an example of how this method is used.

        whole element content visible without the need for scrollbars (if
        possible), and while the content remains "intact" (if possible).

        The meaning of "element content" and "intact" depends on the type of
        element. For example, for a "FalagardStaticText" widget, the content is
        the text, and "intact" means no single word is split between 2 or more
        lines. So calling this method returns whether if we set the element size
        to "element_size" the whole text would be visible, without the need for
        scrollbars, and without having to split a single word between 2 or more
        lines.
