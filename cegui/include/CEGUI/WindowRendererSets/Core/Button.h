        States (missing states will default to 'Normal'):
            - Normal    - Rendering for when the button is neither pushed or has the cursor hovering over it.
            - Hover     - Rendering for then the button has the cursor hovering over it.
            - Pushed    - Rendering for when the button is pushed and cursor is over it.
            - PushedOff - Rendering for when the button is pushed and cursor is not over it.
            - Disabled  - Rendering for when the button is disabled.
