\brief 
        Enum for specifying the default direction of paragraphs (Also known as "direction" in CSS
        and LayoutDirection in Qt. Relevant for bidirectional text)
        
        This is only in effect if raqm is linked and activate. Specifies the default order of words in a
        paragraph, which is relevant when having sentences in a RightToLeft language that may start with a word
        (or to be specific: first character of a word) from a LeftToRight language.
        Example: If the mode is set to Automatic and the first word of a paragraph in Hebrew is a German
        company name, written in German alphabet, the German word will end up left, whereas the rest of
        the Hebrew sentences starts from the righ, continuing towards the left. With the setting RightToLeft
        the sentence will start on the very right with the German word, as would be expected in a mainly
        RightToLeft written paragraph. If the language of the UI user is known, then either LeftToRight
        or RightToLeft should be chosen for the paragraphs.
 */
enum class DefaultParagraphDirection : int
{
    //! Default direction is from left to right, as used in most of the modern European and Asian languages .
    LeftToRight,
    //! Default direction is from right to left, as used in Hebrew, Persian and Arabic.
    RightToLeft,
    //! Default direction is specified automatically, depending on the first word (specifically: the first character of the first word).
    Automatic
