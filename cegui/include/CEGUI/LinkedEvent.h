\brief
    LinkedEvent is an Event subclass that provides a mechanism to link or chain
    Events together, such that when a specified target event is fired, then
    this event will additionally fire in response.
    \par
    The expected use of this mechanism is for container or compound widgets to
    be able to expose events of component widgets without needing to provide
    repetetive boilerplate event forwarding code, and also for scenarios where
    code is not typically provided (i.e. data based skinning scenarios).
