\brief
    Interface providing event signaling and handling

    The EventSet is a means for code to attach a handler function to some
    named event, and later, for that event to be fired and the subscribed
    handler(s) called.

    Its purpose is similar to Qt's signal and slot system, you can think of
    Event name as the signal and the subscribed handler as the slot.

    Each Event has a name and a set of handlers. Handlers can be free functions,
    class member functions or even functors. Whenever an Event is fired all of
    its handlers are invoked. You are most likely looking for a way to react
    to mouse clicks or other events fired internally by CEGUI.

    The handlers have to have a very specific signature. They have to return
    bool and they have to take const EventArgs&. If this is not met you will
    encounter build errors!

\par Reacting to internal CEGUI events

\code{.cpp}
bool handler(const EventArgs& args)
{
    std::cout << "Don't you dare click me again!" << std::endl;

    // returning true means we handled the Event and it doesn't need to be
    // propagated any further
    return true;
}

void example()
{
    CEGUI::Window* wnd = ...;
    wnd->subscribeEvent(CEGUI::Window::EventMouseClick, &handler);
}
\endcode

\par A contrived example of various handler types

\code{.cpp}
bool freeFunction(const EventArgs& args)
{
    // your handler code here
}

// nothing special about this class!
class CustomClass
{
    public:
        bool memberFunction(const EventArgs& args)
        {
            // your handler code here
        }

        static bool staticMemberFunction(const EventArgs& args)
        {
            // your handler code here
        }

        bool memberFunctionWithArg(const EventArgs& args, bool something)
        {
            // your handler code here
        }
};

class Functor
{
    public:
        bool operator()(const EventArgs& args)
        {
            // your handler code here
        }
}

void example()
{
    CustomClass instance;

    CEGUI::Window* wnd = ...;

    // creates "CustomEvent", subscribes freeFunction to it
    wnd->subscribeEvent("CustomEvent", &freeFunction);
    // subscribes memberFunction of "instance" to CustomEvent
    wnd->subscribeEvent("CustomEvent", &CustomClass::memberFunction, &instance);
    // subscribes staticMemberFunction of CustomClass to CustomEvent
    wnd->subscribeEvent("CustomEvent", &CustomClass::staticMemberFunction);
    // subscribes Functor to CustomEvent, Functor instance is owned by EventSet
    // after this call, it will be destroyed by EventSet
    wnd->subscribeEvent("CustomEvent", Functor());

    // Advanced subscribers using boost::bind follow:

    // subscribes memberFunctionWithArg of CustomClass to CustomEvent
    wnd->subscribeEvent("CustomEvent", boost::bind(&CustomClass::memberFunctionWithArg, _1, _2, true), &instance);
    // same as above, binding the instance itself as well
    wnd->subscribeEvent("CustomEvent", boost::bind(&CustomClass::memberFunctionWithArg, instance, _1, true));

    // the following line causes all subscribed handlers to be called
    wnd->fireEvent("CustomEvent");
}
\endcode

\par EventSet works well with others
    The EventSet can also subscribe boost::function, std::function, functors
    created by boost::bind and possibly others. This is not a feature of
    CEGUI per se, just a fortunate side effect of being able to call functors.

\par Events are automatically created on demand
    As of CEGUI 0.5, the EventSet no longer needs to be filled with available events.
    Events are now added to the set as they are first used; that is, the first
    time a handler is subscribed to an event for a given EventSet, an Event
    object is created and added to the EventSet.

    Instead of throwing an exception when firing an event that does not actually
    exist in the set, we now do nothing (if the Event does not exist, then it
    has no handlers subscribed, and therefore doing nothing is the correct
    course action).
