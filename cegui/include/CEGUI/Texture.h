\brief
    Abstract base class specifying the required interface for Texture objects.

    Texture objects are created via the Renderer.  The actual inner workings of
    any Texture object are dependant upon the Renderer (and underlying API) in
    use.  This base class defines the minimal set of functions that is required
    for the rest of the system to work.  Texture objects are only created
    through the Renderer object's texture creation functions.
