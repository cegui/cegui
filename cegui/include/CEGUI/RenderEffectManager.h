        Register a RenderEffect type with the system and associate it with the
        identifier \a name.

        This registers a RenderEffect based class, such that instances of that
        class can subsequently be created by requesting an effect using the
        specified identifier.

    \tparam T
        The RenderEffect based class to be instantiated when an effect is
        requested using the identifier \a name.

    \param name
        String object describing the identifier that the RenderEffect based
        class will be registered under.

        be removed / unregistered.  If no such RenderEffect is present, no
        action is taken.

    \note
        You should avoid removing RenderEffect types that are still in use.
        Internally a factory system is employed for the creation and deletion
        of RenderEffect objects; if an effect - and therefore it's factory - is
        removed while instances are still active, it will not be possible to
        safely delete those RenderEffect object instances.
