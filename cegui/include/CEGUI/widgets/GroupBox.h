\brief
    Base class for standard GroupBox widget.

\deprecated
    You should consider not using this class. It performs no useful function
    and can be replicated 100% accurately via an XML based WidgetLook
    definition.  If you are already using this and need to migrate, you can
    usually do so by changing the following:
    - in the looknfeel (WidgetLook) change the the \<Child\> element for
    "__auto_contentpane__" into a \<NamedArea\> with the name "inner_rect" (and
    remove anything other than the \<Area\> definition).
    - in the scheme file, change the targetType from "CEGUI/GroupBox" to
    "DefaultWindow".
