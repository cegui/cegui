\brief
    Base class for the ScrollablePane widget.

    The ScrollablePane widget allows child windows to be attached which cover an
    area larger than the ScrollablePane itself and these child windows can be
    scrolled into view using the scrollbars of the scrollable pane.

    Note: If the content pane is set to be auto-sized, and not both (horizontal
    and vertical) scrollbars are set to be always visible, and any of the
    children's size is not set to be an absolute dimension (i.e. its relative
    component is non-zero), this creates a circular dependency which may lead to
    a crash. Please don't use such a combination. It'll probably not be allowed
    in future versions of CEGUI.
