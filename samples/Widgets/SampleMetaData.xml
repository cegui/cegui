    summary         = "The widgets sample allows to choose any of widgets from the stock CEGUI skins. The widget will then be displayed and is ready for interaction. All occuring events will be logged in the event logger below the widget display. By accessing the &quot;Properties&quot; tab, the user can see all properties the widget has and their respective current values."
    description     = "The demo's code is quite specific and probably not of use for most projects using CEGUI. The main purpose of this sample is demonstration of the widgets and their triggered effects. It makes use of the list of mapped widgets and subscribes to all throwable events of it. The properties are retrieved from the widget using the PropertyIterator. The greatest use of this demo for users is to see the available properties of specific widgets and to interactively inspect how events are thrown and how widgets look. Additionally the special setup of certain widgets, for example in initItemListbox(), initListbox(), initMenubar() and initMultiColumnList(), can be useful interesting to look at in the code"
