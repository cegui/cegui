The following is a high-level view of changes made to the system between releases.

Release 0.5.0 (Final)
=====================
Added: TaharezLook was missing ItemListbox and ListboxItem windows & skin definitions.
Added: Partial CEGUI support for MingW. It is now possible to build CEGUI under mingw with support for OpenGL renderer. This approach is going to be generalized later to the other renderer and wiki page explaining the process will follows.
Added: Missing functions in WindowFactoryManager Lua bindings. Incomplete FalagardWindowMapping binding as well.
Added: Lua binding for OutStream: FileStream (minimal std::ofstream).
Added: XML writing function in Lua bindings.
Added: --enable-debug in configure script instead of using CPPFLAGS=-DDEBUG ./configure ...
Added: premake files for Minesweeper sample and minor fixes to make it run in windows.
Added: the minesweeper demo
Added: missing doxyfile in order to be in make dist
Added: ScrollablePane sample

Removed: Empty Font 'implData' header files we no longer use.
Removed: Falagard skinning manual is now a part of the CEGUI manuals sub-project, so is no longer included here as a pdf.

Modified: Changed Demo7 to use the layout XML file instead of hard-coded window creation.
Modified: Demo7Window.layout now uses the new ItemListbox, with items defined within the layout, as the Listbox as opposed to the old style list with hard-coded items.
Modified: Win32CEGuiRendererSelector:
- It is now possible to navigate to the Combobox via keyboard.
- First available renderer is pre-selected into the dialog.
- With a single renderer available, it is auto-selected and dialog is not shown.
Modified: Changed compile order under autotools so CEGUIBase is made before things that use it - related to forthcoming cross-compile support.
Modified Added some missing bits and a whole load of other stuff to 'make dist' to ease a more unified approach to creating packages for the various platforms.
Modified: Renamed tolua++bin/remake_pkg..bat to remove extra period
Modified: Changed Russian text in FontDemo sample - the old text apparently potentially offensive. Thanks to 'Sanya' for the updated text.
Modified: The RefCounted template now has the CEGUIEXPORT macro as it avoids warnings in client code when using MSVC.
Modified: Promote Expat to be the second prefered parser under linux in order to act the same under linux and Win32. Note that the prefered parser is still Xerces. The parser order is now the following : Xerces, Expat, Libxml, TinyXML.
Modified: WidgetComponent had a nasty misspelling of 'Alignemnt'.
Modified: MSVC no longer uses CEGUIConfig.h and CEGUISamplesConfig.h for anything
Modified: Premake scripts are now much more flexible.

Coding Standards: Removed various occurrences of the NULL macro.

Docs: Added note to docs for Spinner regarding the lame state of floating point support.

Bug Fix: ListHeader settings for sizing, moving, and clicking were not properly set on newly created segments.
Bug Fix: Resolved issue where the algorithm that ensured font textures were filled would actually end up trying to render every glyph within a font.
Bug Fix: ItemListBase::insertItem was not setting the ItemEntry::d_ownerList member correctly.
Bug Fix: Added another 'special case' to Spinner::getValueFromText to support typing an initial decimal point.
Bug Fix: Sometimes compound widgets did not get their components layed out properly when adding the widget to it's parent.
Bug Fix: The way in which properties would set a window to use the DefaultFont was incorrect; it explicitly set it to the name of the current default, as opposed to a 'floating default'.
Bug Fix: FontDim did not work correctly since re-calculation of the layout was not triggered in response to the font being changed.  Added this code to Window::onFontChanged - although more elegant / selective solutions might be considered later on.
Bug Fix: Added code so that all windows using default font get notified of a change in the default via the normal channel (Window::onFontChanged).
Bug Fix: There was an issue regarding auto-repeat of mouse button down events not getting their state reset if the mouse button was released outside of the window getting the auto-repeat events.
Bug Fix: CEGuiSample.cpp did not get all required includes with certain renderer combinations.
Bug Fix: Range emplyed by FreeTypeFont::rasterize was exclusive of the start element; first glyph of every page loaded was missed!
Bug Fix: CEGUI::Window did not properly clean-up a custom tooltip if it created one.
Bug Fix: Calculation of number of glyph pages in Font::setMaxCodepoint was incorrect.
Bug Fix: When the OpenGL renderer was disabled by ./configure, the SILLY codec was still being built.
Bug Fix: When the OpenGL renderer was disabled by ./configure, the requirement for a default ImageCodec was still enforced.
Bug Fix: case of included file in Win32CEGuiRendererSelector.cpp changed ready to support cross-compiling in post 0.5.0 versions.
Bug Fix: Support was broken in the Samples framework for newer versions of Ogre.
Bug Fix: The cegui_reldim and cegui_absdim macros were missing the CEGUI namespace qualifier.
Bug Fix: When a glyph failed to load in FreeTypeFont, although we logged the error we did not work around the issue of the missing glyph image, so a seg fault was generated upon attempted use of those missing images. This addresses the issue by creating dummy images for missing font glyphs which use a zero size. Mantis #0000125.
Bug Fix: RefCounted would call AddRef when the wrapped pointer and its counter were null.
Bug Fix: Event::ScopedConnection would call members of BoundSlot using a potentially null RefCounted pointer.
Bug Fix: In C++ a namespace does not have a semicolon after the closing brace.
Bug Fix: Nasty memory leak in DevIL image codec. thanx to mafm on IRC.
Bug Fix: fixed a small error in the comment of CEGUI_DECLARE_WINDOW_FACTORY
Bug Fix: Tab control did not require to hear about multi-clicks on the TabControl scroll buttons. Patch from zap. Mantis #0000117.
Bug Fix: Issue with utf8 missing conversion in TinyXML and libXML
Bug Fix: Added missing public visibility specifier to ScopedConnection class members.
Bug Fix: premake files were not enabling Xerces correctly in the samples.
Bug Fix: TabControlDemo layout split up. We dont allow multiple root windows in a layout when using a validating XML parser.
Bug Fix: Falagard.xsd was missing new type attribute for PropertyDim.
Bug Fix: PropertyLinkDefinition was not writing XML properly (no base class writing).
Bug Fix: Bugs in Falagard XML writing.
Bug Fix: Spinner would throw an exception when a lone minus sign was entered. Mantis ticket #110.
Bug Fix: Input capture bug that broke Combobx - introduced by patch #82.
Bug Fix: ScrollablePane would cause exceptions on destruction. Mantis ticket #83.
Bug Fix: a bug in the premake improvements where samples would not generate properly.
Bug Fix: A number of CEGUI exceptions were being caught by value instead of reference.
Bug Fix: OpenGL renderer now also disables texture coordinate generation.
Bug Fix: Irrlicht sample driver now quits on the escape key like the rest.
Bug Fix: Updates and fixes to resolve the NPOT texture source data issue (mantis #45) in a relatively consistent way - at least for the 0.5.x releases.

Release 0.5.0-RC1
=================
CEGUI MK2 has moved to the MIT license.

Various internal code cleanups:
- Removal of unrequired utf8* casts on string literals.
- Removed use of NULL macro from the library code.
- Code refactorings to Font class. Removes some instances of repeated code, and makes some methods shorter / cleaner.
- Split large methods in Scheme into smaller, more managable, chunks.
- Removed all the System constructor overloads and replaced with a single method.
- Removed string literals for component widget names which were scattered throughout the widget code.
- Replaced virtually all member fields holding pointers to component widgets with getter methods (which basically allows those widgets to be replaced without the parent knowing or caring).
- Refactoring of XML handler to remove huge if/else if/else construct.
- Refectored large if / else if / else constructs in all non-falagard XML handlers to use a member function for each element type (rather than having all code in one huge function).
- Event system has been rewritten from scratch.
- Font system has been rewritten.

Added "PushedOff" rendering state for button based widgets and MenuItem.
Added: Ability to rename windows.
Added: CEGUISamplesConfig.h file to allow configuration of samples framework independently of the main config (saves recompiling everything just to change some sample setting).
Added: FPS readout to OpenGL base app in the samples framework.
Added: "PropertyLinkDefinition" element for Falagard system.
Added: "controlPropery" attribute to SectionSpecififations under falagard to enable renering of section imagery to be controled via a named boolean property.
Added: mouse pass through feature in Window, to ignore mouse events. Nice for making a DefaultWindow transparent to the mouse regarding picking windows behind it.
Added: MSVC++ auto-linking for Ogre base app in samples framework.
Added: grab/restoreTextures in the OpenGL renderer to cache texture image data, and later restore it.
Added: Abstracted Logger interface to support user created custom loggers. (SF patch #1414121 by zap)
Added: DefaultLogger implementation (SF patch #1414121 by zap)
Added: page up/down key functionality to MultiLineEditbox (SF patch #1347376 by Dalfy)
Added: small script to recreate the binding generator for tolua++
Added: customized tolua++ binary. For exception handling support in generated binding code.
Added: missing exception definitions file needed to generate the bindings.
Added: README with instructions on how to generate the bindings.
Added: Documentation for some of the new features in the bundled tolua++ generator.
Added: When subscribing to events from "inside" Lua a self object can be registered as well to be passed along with the EventArgs.
Added: New WindowRenderer system, replacing previous system where the Window sub-class controlled the rendering process.
Added: Major update of the LuaScriptModule to support anonymous functions.
Added: Exception handling has been added for some functions.
Added: Falagard derivatives of DefaultWindow, DragContainer and ItemEntry with minimal StateImagery.
Added: executeEventHandler now accepts functions that are table fields.
Added: Text node support to both parser (Xerces and TinyXML)
Added: AutoWindow tag to xml layouts to fetch a window created by the look'n'feel or the base widget itself.
Added: Window::isAutoWindow member that returns true if the window has "__auto_" in its name. (a flag is set in the constructor). It's faster than checking the actual string.
Added: A setting to Window to specify that it should never write XML no matter what if activated. Tooltips get this set by default by System.
Added: A property ban list to provide a system for mapping which properties should (not) be written to XML. In the respective addProperties member functions checks have been added and some properties are banned if we are an auto window.
Added: Default resource group support to Xerces for use when loading schema files.
Added: Default resource group support to ScriptingModule, and implemented it's use in the CEGUILua module.
Added: DynamicModule class to wrap access to a dynamically linked / loaded module.
Added: New dynamic libraries for Xerces, Expat TinyXMLParser, and libxml Parsers.
Added: TextProperty and FontProperty elements for Falagard text components.
Added: New ItemListBase based ItemListbox widget. For Window based listbox items.
Added: XML Serialization class for all XML writing.
Added: Recursive versions of Window::getChild and isChild by ID. They are called getChildRecursive and isChildRecursive. Reason for the explicit naming is that it's a pretty expensive operation and should not be used unless necessary.
Added: Lots of missing members in the Lua bindings.
Added: setlocale(LC_NUMERIC, "C"); to the System constructor as we depend on this behaviour.
Added: setVisible member to CEGUI::MouseCursor.
Added: bat files to make it easier for Windows users to regenerate the Lua bindings and tolua++cegui.
Added: ImageCodec support to the OpenGL renderer. This allows users to easily write a custom image loader. TGA, SILLY, DevIL, Corona and FreeImage codecs are supplied.
Added: const version of getDataPtr in RawDataContainer.
Added: premake scripts to generate MSVC solutions.
Added: ClippedContainer for situations where more specialized clipping is required.

Modified: Placed the integrated TinyXML into its own namespace (CEGUITinyXML) to prevent clashes in projects using another copy of TinyXML. (Patch #1294002).
Modified: Changed EventSet to operate without needing events to be pre-added, much like GlabalEventSet always did.
Modified: Removal of mass pre-specification of events for all classes using events.
Modified: Cflags to add include dir for CEGUI in CEGUI.pc.in (allows use of <CEGUI/...> form of include statement).
Modified: The "Lua and tolua++" module has been made a DLL on Windows machines.
Modified: Renamed System::setTooltip to System::setDefaultTooltip (Mantis #1Cool.
Modified: In the lua module, updated Window with casting helpers as member functions. eg. w:toFrameWindow()
Modified: Removed the Static,StaticText and StaticImage from CEGUIBase and implemented them in FalagardBase instead.
Modified: Updated to tolua++ 1.0.92
Modified: Moved LuaFunctor into its own files
Modified: Reimplemented the "late binding" effect from the v04 Lua module. In v04 the function is always looked up by name. In CVS HEAD the actual Lua function is referenced, but now this will only occur the first time the event is triggered. This means that it's no longer necessary to have a function defined to subscribe it to an event. As long as the function has been created before the event occurs everything will be good Smile
Modified: Moved subscribeScriptedEvent into ScriptModule to allow more customized script subscription functionality.
Modified: Made the layout XML handler use subscribeScriptedEvent for Event tags instead of subscribeEvent with ScriptFunctor
Modified: Removal of "tolua_outside" stuff that was no longer needed.
Modified: Moved the declaration/definition of base window factories into its own files.
Modified: Removal of WidgetSets folder, and it's contents.
Modified: Removed unnecessary getSingleton and getSingletonPtr from manager classes.
Modified: The script module now throws ScriptException.
Modified: Removal of TextItem as falagard now handles that exclusively.
Modified: Moved all rendering member functions out of base classes an into Falagard rendering classes.
Modified: Removal of virtually all rendering and layout related Window properties from CEGUIBase - a few are moved to FalagardBase, the rest must be implemented via XML.
Modified: Removal of TaharezLook and WindowsLook modules from the system.
Modified: Removal of MetricsMode system, and all non-unified interface and properties from Window (and related fixes to other classes).
Modified: Elimination of RenderableElement and derived classes.
Modified: Moved to a C preprocessor macro system for widget module creation.
Modified: Removal of abstract createXXX methods from widget base classes - the looknfeel system now auto-creates these widgets when specified within the XML.
Modified: Updated to TinyXML 2.4.3 in order to allow CDATA section in XML text node (verbatim text)
Modified: GUILayout handler in order to support long value in properties.
Modified: Made the XML writing system aware of falagard when determining property default values.
Modified: Switched PropertyHelper to use std::ostringstream as the output is much nicer. Changed property default values to the new format where needed.
Modified: Better error reporting for dynamic module load failures.
Modified: Switched to using external pcre library. Removed embedded copy of pcre.
Modified: Switched system to use dynamic libs for XML parsers with programatically configurable default.
Modified: FactoryModule to use DynamicModule.
Modified: Resolved issue with unneeded member qualification (Patch #1454773).
Modified: Made String::ptr a public member.
Modified: The bundled tolua++cegui binding generator will now generate a lua_CEGUI.cpp that compiles out-of-the-box on Windows
Modified: Removed the DataContainer template class, and made it into just RawDataContainer, non templated.
Modified: Optimized FalagardMultiLineEditbox to only cache visible lines when rendering.
Modified: Optimized ButtonBase and MenuItem updateInternalState. Mantis #44
Modified: Moved the renderers to their own folder named RendererModules.
Modified: Optimized picking and rendering by caching screen space rectangles.
Modified: Applied zap's rewrite of the Font system. Patch #1508321
Modified: Texture::loadFromMemory now takes a Texture::PixelFormat parameter. RGB and RGBA are currently required. Fixes Patch #1455523 as well. 3rd party renderer modules needs to be updated.

Bug Fix: Added missing performChildWindowLayout to Scrollbar::onScrollConfigChanged to allow making a look'n'feel with a thumb that sizes to indicate document size.
Bug fix: const correctness for Window::getLookNFeel
Bug fix: FrameWindow, isTitlebarEnabled and isCloseButtonEnabled were return the opposite of what they should.
Bug Fix: FrameWindow should do relayout if text changes to allow using a fontdim in the titlebar dimensions.
Bug Fix: Changing the default mouse cursor in the System object will now update the cursor immediately where appropriate. (Ticket #17).
Bug Fix: Fixed case in StaticText where default text area was always used if frame was disabled.

Bug Fix: MultiColumnList getNextSelection bug. Mantis #47
Bug Fix: System subscriber to renderer event but does not unsubscribe on destruction. Mantis #48
Bug Fix: OpenGL and DirectX9 renderers were not handling error correctly when creating textures.
Bug Fix: Bug in LuaScriptModule where executeScriptFile did not unload the file data buffer correctly in case of an exception (thanks gcarlton).
Bug Fix: A bug in ItemListBase::resetList_impl where calling resetList would crash (thanks Turtle).

Bug Fix: Big Endian inconsistency in CEGUI::colour.
Bug Fix: CEGUI::Window was not detaching the tooltip during destruction. Mantis #38
Bug Fix: FrameWindow was consuming all LeftButton up events. Down events were affected as well, and now only consume if the event started drag sizing.
